# Practices
some C++ coding practices, the code is dirty and rushed
1. given some matrices in several text files, perform matrix operations like transpose() or matrix_multiplication() and stores each output result in separate file.
2. given unsorted data in several text files, perform sorting and binary search (with duplicates) and stores each output result in a separate file.
