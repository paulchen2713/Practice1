# Practices
some C++ coding practices, the code is dirty and rushed
1. given some matrices in a text file, perform matrix operations like transpose() or matrix_multiplication() and store the output results in a text file.
2. given unsorted data in a text file, perform sorting and binary search (with duplicates) and store the output results in a text file.
